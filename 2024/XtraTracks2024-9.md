### Tim Walz - Data4Life.care [(XtraTrack Season 2024)](XtraTracksOverview)

[Overview](XtraTracksOverview)

<p style="font-size:11px">02.09.2024</p>

<p style="font-size:11px"> Multiple factors influence our health and are increasingly covered by wearable devices to generate real-world evidence at a large scale, improve therapeutic approaches and outcomes, or help understand new determinants of health. With all this data available, common tools and processes to collect real-world data at scale or in remote settings often come to their limits. With D4L Collect, Data4Life builds a sensor data collection platform that supports researchers in planning, conducting, and managing large-scale digital studies in health research. The platform allows data from digital questionnaires and a wide range of sensors and wearables to be collected centrally and stored securely. This talk provides an overview of the features of the data collection platform as well as current use cases.</p>
