### Roland Stenger - Move2Screen: An Android App for symptomatic Monitoring of Dystonia [(XtraTrack Season 2024)](XtraTracksOverview)

[Overview](XtraTracksOverview)

<p style="font-size:11px">Movement disorders are characterized by a paucity or excess of movement. Access to specialists is difficult for patients living in rural areas, making regular visits for symptom monitoring inconvenient. Asynchronous video recording represents a telemedicine approach with temporal freedom, but has the challenge that clinicians and patients can't interact and therefore can't correct errors, which can lead to a decrease in data quality. We therefore propose Move2Screen, an Android application that aims to enable asynchronous therapy monitoring and addresses the problem of lack of interaction by implementing an in-app video protocol for guided recording to capture visible symptoms in the example of cervical dystonia. The videos can be accessed by clinicians after an automated upload. A user study of the app was conducted over a 3-month period and showed strong interest and acceptance with a high willingness to use the app, according to an experience questionnaire. In addition, the app can be used to collect a standardized dataset, allowing a large number of patients to be reached with little effort on the part of clinicians, and also provides the opportunity for semi-automated video-based analysis of current symptoms and longitudinal symptom progression.</p>
