### Sven Meister, Leonard Fehring - Digital Health Applications  [(XtraTrack Season 2025)](/2025/XtraTracksOverview)

[Overview](/2025/XtraTracksOverview)

<p style="font-size:11px">(02-07-2025 16:00)</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">Mobile health apps are a modern innovation in medicine. They offer new ways to support treatment and make access to healthcare easier. Worldwide, there are many free or ad-funded apps available. However, most of them are not officially tested or approved. To ensure quality and safety, Germany introduced the concept of DiGA. DiGA stands for "Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen" (Digital Health Applications). These are medical apps that have proven a medical benefit in official studies. Doctors in Germany can prescribe DiGA, and health insurance usually pays for them. The talk will investigate the worldwide mHealth landscape and deepdive into the field of DiGA in Germany. </p>
