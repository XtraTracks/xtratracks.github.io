### Dominik Heider - AI in Bioinformatics: Fighting the global threat of antimicrobial resistance [(XtraTrack Season 2025)](/2025/XtraTracksOverview)

[Overview](/2025/XtraTracksOverview)

<p style="font-size:11px">28-05-2025 16:00</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize biomedicine by enhancing diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic insights across complex biomedical datasets, including clinical records, imaging, and omics data. However, applying AI to biomedicine presents unique challenges: specialized data types such as sequences, limited sample sizes, severe class imbalances, the critical need for model interpretability, and stringent data protection regulations. This talk outlines these challenges and explores cutting-edge solutions, including privacy-preserving strategies like Federated and Swarm Learning. Special focus is given to the pressing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), demonstrating how AI models can predict resistance patterns and cross-resistance using innovative machine learning approaches. Case studies on AMR in environmental samples and decentralized differential abundance analysis illustrate the potential of AI-driven collaboration in medicine without compromising patient data security.</p>
