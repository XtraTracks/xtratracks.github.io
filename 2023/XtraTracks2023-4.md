### Remko Soer - Is the randomized controlled trial still the holy grail in health research? [(XtraTrack Season 2023)](XtraTracksOverview)

[Overview](XtraTracksOverview)

<p style="font-size:11px">(28.06.2023)</p>

<p style="font-size:11px">The randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been widely accepted as the holy grail and lists the top of the evidence pyramid. The drawbacks of RCTs are frequently neglected but are related to the absence of valuable patient context, limited generalizability or regression to the mean.
Above all, a patient tailored intervention cannot validly be made based on RCT evidence. In the research community, other methods are emerging to better individualize treatment of patients. In this lecture, Remko will present multiple alternatives for the RCT, and will discuss small and big scale methodologies including Case studies, especially the N‑of‑1 trial, and machine learning approaches to match treatment based on the patients characteristics.</p>
